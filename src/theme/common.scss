/**
 * - Here we defined all the css common to all components.
 * - For any component-specific css, defined it in a file with the same name as the component importing it.
 *
 * Make sure to identify the components with a custom class and then use specification to apply the style:
 * - .class1 .class2 (for when class2 is inside a class1 element)
 * - .class1.class2 (when an element is both class1 and class2)
 * - +, > and other combinators to target direct children, sibling and adjacent components
 * - (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Combinators)
